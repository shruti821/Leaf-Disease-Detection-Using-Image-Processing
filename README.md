# Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Image-Processing
Agricultural productivity is something on which economy highly depends. This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. For instance a disease named little leaf disease is a hazardous disease found in pine trees in United States. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves.Â This paper introduces an efficient approach to identify healthy and diseased or an infected leaf using image processing and machine learning techniques. Various diseases damage the chlorophyll of leaves and affect with brown or black marks on the leaf area. These can be detected using image prepossessing, image segmentation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the machine learning algorithms is used for classification. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) resulted in a improved accuracy of recognition compared to the SVM approach.
